		<a href="https://amzn.to/34K1sfg" target="_blank"><h1>Playstation Move</h1></a>
		<p>developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. Initially released in 2009 for use with the PlayStation 3 video game console, its compatibility was later expanded to its successor, the PlayStation 4, in 2013, and its PlayStation VR platform in 2016. Conceptually similar to Nintendo's Wii Remote and Microsoft's Kinect, its function is based around controller input in games stemming from the actual physical movement of the player. The Move uses inertial sensors in the wand to detect motion while the wand's position is tracked using a PlayStation Eye or PlayStation Camera. The device was generally well-received by critics, but has not quite met Sony's goals for integration into the market.</p>

		<p>Oculus Touch is the motion controller system used by Oculus VR in their Rift, Oculus Rift S, and Quest virtual reality systems. Two iterations of the controllers have been developed; the first for use in the original Oculus Rift, which uses external tracking, and the second one for use with the Rift S and the Oculus Quest, which use inside-out tracking.</p>

		<p> The controllers have multiple input methods including a track pad, grip buttons, and a dual-stage trigger and a use per charge of about 6 hours.[25] Across the ring of the controller are 24 infrared sensors that detect the base stations to determine the location of the controller.[26] The SteamVR Tracking system is used to track the controller location to a fraction of a millimeter, with update rates ranging from 250 Hz to 1 kHz.</p>
